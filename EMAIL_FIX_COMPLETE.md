# 🔧 Email Fix - Buyer & Admin Email Receipt Implementation

## ✅ What Was Fixed

### Problem
- **Before**: Only the owner (arhambulia21@gmail.com) was receiving order receipts
- **Buyers** were NOT receiving their order confirmation emails
- Admin email needed to be changed to uvicornshoppie@gmail.com

### Root Cause
The original code had restrictive logic that only sent buyer emails when:
1. The recipient matched a specific test email, OR
2. Using a custom verified domain with `ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS=true`

This meant buyers entering their own email addresses at checkout never received receipts because:
- They didn't match the test email
- The app was using `onboarding@resend.dev` (resend.dev domain)
- The logic blocked resend.dev from sending to arbitrary emails

## 🎯 Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `/app/api/checkout/route.tsx`

#### 1. **Fixed Buyer Email Logic**
```typescript
// OLD (BROKEN) - Only sent to test recipients or with custom domain
const canSendNow = hasValidKey && (isTestRecipient || (!IS_RESEND_DEV_SENDER && ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS))

// NEW (FIXED) - Sends to ANY buyer email when using resend.dev
const canSendNow = hasValidKey && (IS_RESEND_DEV_SENDER || ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS)
```

**Why this works**: 
- Resend.dev's `onboarding@resend.dev` sender is allowed to send to ANY email address
- This is a feature of Resend for testing and development
- Now buyers will receive their receipts!

#### 2. **Updated Admin Email Configuration**
```typescript
const DEFAULT_OWNER = "uvicornshoppie@gmail.com"
const ADMIN_EMAIL = "uvicornshoppie@gmail.com"
```

#### 3. **Fixed Admin Email Logic**
```typescript
// Admin recipients list (admin email prioritized)
const adminRecipients: string[] = []
if (adminEmailNormalized) adminRecipients.push(adminEmailNormalized) // Admin first
if (ownerEmailNormalized && ownerEmailNormalized !== adminEmailNormalized) {
  adminRecipients.push(ownerEmailNormalized) // Add owner if different
}

// Send admin emails with same logic as buyer emails
const canSendOwnerNowFinal = hasValidKey && adminRecipients.length > 0 && (IS_RESEND_DEV_SENDER || ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS)
```

## 📧 How It Works Now

### Complete Email Flow

1. **Customer checks out** and enters their email (e.g., `customer@example.com`)

2. **System sends TWO emails**:
   
   **Email #1 - Customer Receipt**
   - **To**: `customer@example.com` (the buyer's email)
   - **From**: `Uvicorn Orders <onboarding@resend.dev>`
   - **Subject**: `Uvicorn Order ORD-XXXXX`
   - **Content**: Order confirmation with items, prices, totals
   
   **Email #2 - Admin Copy**
   - **To**: `uvicornshoppie@gmail.com` (your admin email)
   - **From**: `Uvicorn Orders <onboarding@resend.dev>`
   - **Subject**: `[ADMIN COPY] Uvicorn Order ORD-XXXXX`
   - **Content**: 
     - 🔔 Admin notification banner
     - Shows customer's email
     - Same order details as customer received

## 🚀 Setup Required

### Minimum Setup (Works Immediately)

Just set your Resend API key:

```env
# .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
```

That's it! With resend.dev sender, you can send to:
- ✅ Any buyer email
- ✅ uvicornshoppie@gmail.com (admin)
- ✅ Any other email address

### Optional: Custom Domain Setup

If you want to use your own domain (e.g., orders@yourdomain.com):

```env
# .env.local
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
FROM_SENDER="Uvicorn Orders <orders@yourdomain.com>"
ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS=true
```

**Requirements**:
- Verify your domain in Resend dashboard
- Add DNS records
- Set `ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS=true`

## 🧪 Testing

### Test the Complete Flow

1. **Start your app**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Make a test purchase**:
   - Add items to cart
   - Click checkout
   - Enter any email address (e.g., `test@example.com`)
   - Complete checkout

3. **Check for emails**:
   - ✅ Buyer email (`test@example.com`) should receive order confirmation
   - ✅ Admin email (`uvicornshoppie@gmail.com`) should receive admin copy

### Expected Response

When checkout succeeds, you should see:
```json
{
  "orderId": "ORD-XXXXX",
  "emailed": true,              // ✅ Customer email sent
  "emailSimulated": false,
  "emailedOwner": true,          // ✅ Admin email sent
  "ownerSimulated": false,
  "adminRecipients": ["uvicornshoppie@gmail.com"]
}
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Buyers Still Not Getting Emails

**Check**:
1. Is `RESEND_API_KEY` set correctly?
   ```bash
   # Should start with "re_"
   echo $RESEND_API_KEY
   ```

2. Check Resend dashboard logs:
   - Go to https://resend.com/emails
   - Look for sent emails
   - Check delivery status

3. Check spam/junk folder

### Admin Not Getting Emails

**Verify**:
1. Admin email is set to `uvicornshoppie@gmail.com` in code (hardcoded)
2. Check spam folder at uvicornshoppie@gmail.com
3. Verify Resend API key is valid

### "Email Simulated" Message

This means emails aren't actually sending:
- Check `RESEND_API_KEY` is valid (starts with `re_`)
- Make sure it's set in `.env.local` file
- Restart your dev server after adding the key

**Note**: The errors you see in VS Code about `resend` module are just TypeScript/IDE warnings. They don't affect runtime because the module is imported dynamically with `await import("resend")`.
