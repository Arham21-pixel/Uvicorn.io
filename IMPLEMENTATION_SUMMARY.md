# Email Receipt Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### 1. Updated Checkout Route (`app/api/checkout/route.tsx`)
- Added `ADMIN_EMAIL` constant set to `"uvicornshoppie@gmail.com"`
- Modified admin email logic to send to **multiple recipients**:
  - `uvicornshoppie@gmail.com` (your admin email - hardcoded)
  - Owner email from environment variable (if different)
- Enhanced admin email with a notification banner that includes:
  - Visual alert header
  - Customer's email address
  - Complete order details
- Updated subject line to `[ADMIN COPY] Uvicorn Order {orderId}`

### 2. Created Documentation
- **EMAIL_SETUP.md**: Complete setup guide for Resend email service
- **.env.example**: Template for environment variables

## üìß How It Works Now

When a customer checks out:

1. **Customer Email**
   - Sent to: The email address entered by the buyer
   - Contains: Order confirmation and receipt
   - Subject: `Uvicorn Order {orderId}`

2. **Admin Email** 
   - Sent to: 
     - ‚úÖ `uvicornshoppie@gmail.com` (always)
     - ‚úÖ Any owner email configured via `RESEND_TEST_TO` env variable
   - Contains: 
     - Admin notification banner
     - Customer's email address
     - Full order details
   - Subject: `[ADMIN COPY] Uvicorn Order {orderId}`

## üöÄ Next Steps

To activate email sending:

1. **Create `.env.local` file** in the project root:
   ```env
   RESEND_API_KEY=re_your_api_key_here
   FROM_SENDER="Uvicorn Orders <orders@yourdomain.com>"
   ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS=true
   ```

2. **Get Resend API Key**:
   - Sign up at https://resend.com
   - Generate an API key from https://resend.com/api-keys

3. **For Production** (sending to real customers):
   - Verify your domain in Resend
   - Set `FROM_SENDER` to use your verified domain
   - Set `ALLOW_ALL_EMAILS=true`

4. **For Testing**:
   - You can test with the default sender `onboarding@resend.dev`
   - Or add `RESEND_TEST_TO=your-test-email@example.com`

## üìù Testing

1. Start your app: `pnpm dev`
2. Add items to cart
3. Click checkout and enter an email
4. Check the response - you should see:
   - `emailed: true` (customer email sent)
   - `emailedOwner: true` (admin copy sent)
   - `adminRecipients: ["email1", "uvicornshoppie@gmail.com"]`

## üîç Important Notes

- The admin email `uvicornshoppie@gmail.com` is **hardcoded** in the source code
- Both customer and admin emails use the same order details
- Admin email includes a yellow notification banner at the top
- All emails are sent via Resend API
- In development without proper config, emails will be "simulated" (logged but not sent)
